# FanChain Icon Font

This repository contains the icon font used on FanChain websites and apps and contains the glyphs/escape codes referenced in the [FanChain Stamp Database](https://github.com/SportsCastrFanchain/FanChainStampDB)

## Usage

To use on a website, mirror the files, include the CSS file, and reference the glyphs included in the [FanChain Stamp Database](https://github.com/SportsCastrFanchain/FanChainStampDB).  

Then you can include the glyphs in your page: 

```
	<span class="icon-SEND"></span>
```	

To use the generated font in an App, you can include the TTF file and reference the escape codes in the [FanChain Stamp Database](https://github.com/SportsCastrFanchain/FanChainStampDB)

To use the generated font in desktop programs, you can install the TTF font. In order to copy the character associated with each icon, refer to the text box at the bottom right corner of each glyph in demo.html. The character inside this text box may be invisible; but it can still be copied. See this guide for more info: https://icomoon.io/#docs/local-fonts
